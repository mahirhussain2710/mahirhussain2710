Traffic Congestion Solution with Digital Logic
Overview
The escalating issue of traffic congestion in metropolitan cities has reached critical proportions, significantly hampering the efficiency of urban transportation systems. This repository contains a solution developed using combinational and sequential circuits to address the root causes of traffic congestion in metro cities.

Solution Components
Traffic Light Control System: A dynamic traffic light control system that adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions.
Traffic Flow Optimization: Optimization of traffic flow by coordinating traffic signals across multiple intersections.
Dynamic Lane Management: Adjustment of lane configurations on highways or major roads based on traffic volume and congestion levels.
Smart Traffic Routing: Intelligent routing of vehicles to less congested routes in real-time.
Vehicle Detection and Counting: Accurate detection and counting of vehicles at key points in the road network.
Emergency Vehicle Priority: Priority for emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks.
Public Transportation Integration: Integration with public transportation networks to prioritize buses and trains.
Data Analysis and Prediction: Analysis of historical traffic data and prediction of future congestion patterns.
Usage
Each component is implemented as a separate module within the repository.
Instructions for running simulations or deploying the solution are provided in each module's README.
